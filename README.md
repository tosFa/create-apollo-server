# Create Apollo Server
The idea behind this library is to provide a simple way to bootstrap a new graphQL server instance.

Inspired by by projects like `create-react-app` and `create-react-native-app` this project aims to provide a similar service.
 
Unlike the before mentioned projects `create-apollo-server` doesn't hide the implementation and comes without an `eject` command

After initializing a new instance of a graphQL server all dependencies are visible in the `package.json` file.

All the configuration parameters are visible through a .env file that gets auto-generated and can be changed afterwards.

# Install

`yarn add global create-apollo-server`

# Generate new GQL API instance

`create-apollo-server init [project-name]`

`Follow instructions`

`cd [project-name] && yarn start`

go to `localhost:[port]/[gaphiql path]` and start investigating the generated schema

The resulting schema is the same as the one used in the example here https://github.com/apollographql/frontpage-server 


# Current supported configurations include

- GraphQL API port:  *default* (8080)
- GraphQL API path:  *default* (graphql)
- Graphiql interface path: *default* (graphiql)
